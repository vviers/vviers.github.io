Hello! My name is Vincent Viers.

I was born and raised in Paris, France, where I currently live and work.

I am a freelance, full-stack data scientist currently working on digital public services projects.

Outside of work, I aim to spend as much time as possible exploring the outdoors â€” climbing, skiing, hiking, or simply biking around the city.
