I am currently working as a freelance data scientist for [beta.gouv :fr:](https://beta.gouv.fr) — the French incubator for digital public services.
The main projects I am working on are :

- [Signaux Faibles](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/signaux-faibles.html) — early detection of fragile firms for the French Ministry of the Economy

- [Disinfo](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/) — a task force fighting disinformation at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs

I am available for short-term, freelance missions 1 day a week. My fields of expertise are listed [here](/services/).
